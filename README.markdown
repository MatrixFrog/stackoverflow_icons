# Stackoverflow Tag Icons

I really like the way that sponsored tags on Stackoverflow have a little icon 
in them, but most tags are not sponsored so they just have text. Boring, right?
So I wrote a little Greasemonkey script to add icons for all tags. Typically, I
used the favicon from the official website of whatever that tag is about.

### But there's no icon for the `thing-i-really-like` tag!

Well, then you can add it. You don't even need to know any JavaScript. Just add
a line to the part at the top where it says `var icons = {`. Follow the example of
all the tags that are already there. If the tag has hyphens in it, you'll need to
put it in quotes. For the URL, use a 16x16 image. Typically, the "favicon" from a website works well.

Enjoy!
